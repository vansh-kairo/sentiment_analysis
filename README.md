### Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)

#### Project Overview:
Developed a sophisticated machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis of Twitter data, leveraging the power of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to effectively capture and analyze the complex relationships and structures within the data.

#### Key Components:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
  - **Data Collection**: Collected a substantial dataset of tweets using the Twitter API and pre-existing sentiment datasets.
  - **Preprocessing**: Implemented robust preprocessing steps to clean and normalize the tweets, including removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters. Employed tokenization and vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings for feature extraction.

- **Graph Construction**:
  - Constructed a graph where nodes represent individual tweets and edges represent the similarity between tweets, based on cosine similarity of their feature vectors. This graph structure enables the GCN to exploit the relational data inherent in social networks.

- **Model Development**:
  - Designed and implemented a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric. The GCN model consists of multiple layers that aggregate features from neighboring nodes, capturing both local and global patterns in the graph.

- **Training and Evaluation**:
  - Trained the GCN model on the preprocessed Twitter data, optimizing the model using Adam optimizer and appropriate loss functions.
  - Evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Achieved significant results in sentiment classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of GCNs in handling graph-structured data.

#### Technical Skills Utilized:
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, NetworkX, scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, re (regular expressions)
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), TF-IDF, word embeddings
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

#### Project Outcomes:
- Successfully built and deployed a GCN-based model for Twitter sentiment analysis.
- Enhanced understanding of graph-based deep learning techniques and their applications in natural language processing.
- Demonstrated the ability to preprocess and analyze large-scale social media data, providing valuable insights into public sentiment.

This project showcases the application of advanced machine learning techniques to real-world data, highlighting my skills in both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of cutting-edge models.
